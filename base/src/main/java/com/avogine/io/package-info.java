/**
 * The input aspect of the IO package covers all peripheral level interactions such as a keyboard or mouse, 
 * while output should cover display or audio.
 * <p>
 * The sub packages are broken up between the Events themselves, and the listeners for those
 * events. All Event types should extend from the base Event.
